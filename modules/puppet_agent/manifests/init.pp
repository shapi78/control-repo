# == Class: puppet_agent
#
# Upgrades Puppet 3.8 and newer to the requested version.
# Makes Puppet 4 upgrades easier by migrating SSL certs and config files to the
# new Puppet-Agent paths and removing deprecated settings that are no longer
# supported by Puppet 4.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [arch]
#   The package architecture. Defaults to the architecture fact.
# [collection]
#   The Puppet Collection to track. Defaults to 'PC1'.
# [is_pe]
#   Install from Puppet Enterprise repos. Enabled if communicating with a PE master.
# [manage_repo]
#   Boolean to determine whether to configure repositories
#   This is intended to provide the ability to disable configuring a local repo
#   in support of systems that manage external repositories (i.e. spacewalk/satellite)
#   to enable users to add the proper packages to their internal repos
#   and to utilize default package providers for the install
# [package_name]
#   The package to upgrade to, i.e. `puppet-agent`.
# [package_version]
#   The package version to upgrade to. When upgrading from Puppet < 4.0, defaults to
#   the puppet master's latest supported version if compiled with a PE master or
#   undef otherwise (meaning get the latest Open Source release). Explicitly specify
#   a version to upgrade from puppet-agent packages (implying Puppet >= 4.0).
# [service_names]
#   An array of services to start, normally `puppet` and `mcollective`.
#   None will be started if the array is empty.
# [source]
#   The location to find packages.
# [install_dir]
#   The directory the puppet agent should be installed to. This is only applicable for
#   windows operating systems. This only applies when upgrading the agent to a new
#   version; it will not cause re-installation of the same version to a new location.
# [install_options]
#   An array of additional options to pass when installing puppet-agent. Each option in
#   the array can either be a string or a hash. Each option will automatically be quoted
#   when passed to the install command. With Windows packages, note that file paths in an
#   install option must use backslashes. (Since install options are passed directly to
#   the installation command, forward slashes won't be automatically converted like they
#   are in `file` resources.) Note also that backslashes in double-quoted strings _must_
#   be escaped and backslashes in single-quoted strings _can_ be escaped.
# [msi_move_locked_files]
#   This is only applicable for Windows operating systems. There may be instances where
#   file locks cause unncessary service restarts.  By setting to true, the module
#   will move files prior to installation that are known to cause file locks.
